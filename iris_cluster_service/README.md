# IrisClusterAPI

This repository provides a Python API for clustering Iris dataset inputs using a machine learning model hosted on Azure. The model was trained to predict and categorize Iris data into clusters, allowing users to send data via API and receive cluster predictions in response.

> **Note**: The Azure resources for this project may be removed in the future, which could result in the API no longer being accessible.

## Project Overview

This project uses an Azure-hosted machine learning model to predict clusters based on the classic Iris dataset. The Python API serves as an interface for external users to access the model and receive predictions.

### Features
- Clustering prediction for Iris data using an API.
- Accessible interface for integration into other applications.
